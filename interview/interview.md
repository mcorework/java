## Java Interview Questions for Freshers

1. Why is Java a platform independent language?  
   Java code is compiled to bytecode, which can run on any system with a JVM. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

2. Why is Java not a pure object oriented language?  
   Because it supports primitive types (int, char, boolean, etc.) in addition to object types. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

3. Difference between Heap and Stack Memory in Java & usage?  
   - Stack memory: used for method calls, local variables, etc.  
   - Heap memory: used for dynamically created objects. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

4. Can Java be said to be a complete object-oriented programming language?  
   It depends on perspective — while much is object-oriented, primitives make it less “pure.” :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

5. How is Java different from C++?  
   - Java: compiled + interpreted; C++: compiled only  
   - Java: no pointers exposed; C++: pointer arithmetic allowed  
   - Java: automatic memory management (GC); C++: manual memory  
   - Java: no multiple inheritance; C++: supports multiple inheritance :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

6. Why doesn’t Java use pointers (as in C/C++)?  
   To increase safety and simplicity — pointers can lead to memory corruption, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
